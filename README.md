# Open Access Textbooks
- [ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/) - Hadley Wickham's (ggplot2 creator) book on ggplot2. 
- [Data Visualization - A practical introduction](https://socviz.co/) - The online version of Kieran Healy's book on data visualization in R.
- [Data Visualization with R](https://rkabacoff.github.io/datavis/) - Data Visualization with R by Rob Kabacoff. Focused mostly on ggplot2, pbut also covers interactive data visualization and spatial data visualization in R.
- [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/) - A practical guide that provides more than 150 recipes to help you generate high-quality graphs quickly, without having to comb through all the details of R’s graphing systems. 

# Tutorials
- [Creating Publication Quality Base R Graphics](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/styling-base-r-graphics/) - A tutorial on creating publication quality graphics using just the base R plot function.
- [Visualizing COVID-19](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/870) - Visualize the rise of COVID-19 cases globally with ggplot2.
- [Data Carpentry - Data visulization with ggplot2](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/04-visualization-ggplot2.html) - A tutorial in ggplot2 focused on ecology data.
- [The Complete ggplot2 Tutorial](http://r-statistics.co/Complete-Ggplot2-Tutorial-Part1-With-R-Code.html) - An advanced ggplot2 tutorial that covers modifying components, aesthetics, legends, and plot style. Also included is a library of 50 ggplot2 visualizations, with code, for 8 categories: Correlation, Deviation, Ranking, Distribution, Composition, Change, Groups, and Spatial Data.
- [Tufte in R](http://motioninsocial.com/tufte/) - Producing plots in the style of Edward Tufte in R. 
# Examples
- [R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/index.html) - A gallery of hundreds of charts in R, with the corresponding code to reproduce them. A great place to see the vast diversity of plots that can be generated in R using a number of libraries such as ggplot2.

# Packages

## ggplot2
- [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) - A powerful data visulization library in R, based on the Grammar of Graphics.
- [ggprism](https://github.com/csdaw/ggprism) - The ggprism package provides various themes, palettes, and other useful functions to customise ggplots and give them the ‘GraphPad Prism’ look.
- [ggfortify](https://github.com/sinhrks/ggfortify) - This package offers functions to allow automatic visualization of statistical results of popular R packages in ggplot2.

## Data Exploration
- [visdat](https://github.com/ropensci/visdat) - Create preliminary exploratory data visualisations of an entire dataset to identify problems or unexpected features using 'ggplot2'.
- [DataExplorer](https://boxuancui.github.io/DataExplorer/) - Library for conducting exploratory data analysis, including identifying dataframe memory usage and visualizing missing observations.

## 3D Visualization
- [RGL](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgl/index.html) - A library for visualizing 3D scatterplots, good for visualizing multivariate data in 3D.
- [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/3d-charts/) - An interactive data visualization library in R that can be used to visualize 3D scatter plots, line plots, surface plots, mesh plots, streamtube plots, isosurface plots, and tri-surf plots.

## Interactive Data Visualization
- [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/3d-charts/) - An interactive data visualization library in R for producing interactive, publication-quality graphs.
- [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) - Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. 
- [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) - Integrate and control Leaflet interactive JavaScript maps in R.

# Opinions 

Choosing between ggplot2 and base R graphics is not straightforward. Your choice of graphics library will depend heavily on your application and need. These articles are not meant to persuade you in choosing a particular graphics library, but instead help identify some common pitfalls with choosing a library without considering your application and audience.
