# Packages

## ggplot2
- [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) - A powerful data visulization library in R, based on the Grammar of Graphics.
- [ggprism](https://github.com/csdaw/ggprism) - The ggprism package provides various themes, palettes, and other useful functions to customise ggplots and give them the ‘GraphPad Prism’ look.
- [ggfortify](https://github.com/sinhrks/ggfortify) - This package offers functions to allow automatic visualization of statistical results of popular R packages in ggplot2.

## Data Exploration
- [visdat](https://github.com/ropensci/visdat) - Create preliminary exploratory data visualisations of an entire dataset to identify problems or unexpected features using 'ggplot2'.
- [DataExplorer](https://boxuancui.github.io/DataExplorer/) - Library for conducting exploratory data analysis, including identifying dataframe memory usage and visualizing missing observations.

## 3D Visualization
- [RGL](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgl/index.html) - A library for visualizing 3D scatterplots, good for visualizing multivariate data in 3D.
- [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/3d-charts/) - An interactive data visualization library in R that can be used to visualize 3D scatter plots, line plots, surface plots, mesh plots, streamtube plots, isosurface plots, and tri-surf plots.
